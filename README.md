# api-call-challenge - Updated edition

This was initially a quick, build a site in a day done in teams to get to grips with Javascript API calls. Then another day was spent improving a different team's site. Now I want to see what else I can improve and accomplish with it.

You can find the project board [here](https://github.com/CarolineS-QA/api-call-challenge/projects).

The IDE I have been using is Visual Studio Code which you can find [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
